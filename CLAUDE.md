## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

### Common Challenges When Implementing SOPs

**1. Performance vs. Visual Effects**
- Issue: Heavy animations can impact performance
- Solution: Use CSS transforms and opacity, implement reduced motion alternatives, monitor Core Web Vitals

**2. Cross-Browser Compatibility**
- Issue: Modern CSS features (backdrop-filter, WebGL) not universally supported
- Solution: Implement feature detection and fallbacks, test on all major browsers

**3. Mobile Optimization**
- Issue: Desktop-first designs often break on mobile
- Solution: Always use mobile-first approach, test on real devices, optimize touch interactions

**4. Accessibility Compliance**
- Issue: Complex animations and interactions can hinder accessibility
- Solution: Provide keyboard alternatives, use proper ARIA labels, test with screen readers

**5. Content Overload**
- Issue: Trying to implement too many components at once
- Solution: Prioritize based on business goals, phase implementation, A/B test additions

---

## Testing Approach

### Recommended Testing Strategy

**1. Performance Testing**
- Run Lighthouse audits (target: 90+ scores)
- Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Test on slow 3G connections
- Validate image optimization

**2. Cross-Browser Testing**
- Chrome (latest + previous version)
- Firefox (latest + previous version)
- Safari (desktop + iOS)
- Edge (latest)

**3. Device Testing**
- Mobile phones (iOS and Android)
- Tablets (portrait and landscape)
- Desktop (various resolutions)
- Large displays (4K+)

**4. Accessibility Testing**
- Keyboard navigation
