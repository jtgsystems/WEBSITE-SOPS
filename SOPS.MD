# 🔍 Quality Control Gates for Website Design

Lifecycle-aligned SOPs are now split into focused files. Start with the cross-cutting standards, then move through each phase.

## Index
- [00 — 2025 Additional Standards](sops/00-standards.md)
- [01 — Discovery & Planning Gates](sops/01-discovery-planning.md)
- [02 — Design & Prototyping Gates](sops/02-design-prototyping.md)
- [03 — Development Gates](sops/03-development.md)
- [04 — Testing & Validation Gates](sops/04-testing-validation.md)
- [05 — Pre-Launch Gates](sops/05-pre-launch.md)
- [06 — Post-Launch Gates](sops/06-post-launch.md)
- [07 — Operational & Governance Gates](sops/07-operations-governance.md)
- [08 — Gate Review Process & Metrics](sops/08-process-metrics.md)
- [09 — Appendix: Advanced Patterns & Landing Page Elements](sops/09-appendix-advanced.md)

## How to use
- Treat each file as a checklist for its lifecycle; duplicate or tailor per project as needed.
- Keep the 2025 standards in every review; they are cross-cutting requirements.
- When running reviews, attach evidence links next to each item or track in your issue system.
- Re-run Gate Review + Metrics at every major release and after significant incidents.
