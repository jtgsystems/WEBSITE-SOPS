# WEBSITE-SOPS
Some Website SOPS = standard operating procedures. 

## Structure
- `SOPS.MD` — entry point with links to lifecycle-specific SOP files
- `sops/` — split checklists by lifecycle (discovery, design, dev, testing, launch, post-launch, ops) plus cross-cutting 2025 standards and appendices
